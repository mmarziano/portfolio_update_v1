        <h2>Personal History</h2>
        <p>Princess Adora, along with her twin brother Prince Adam, was born to King Randor and Queen Marlena on the planet Eternia. The planet was attacked shortly afterwards by the forces of Hordak who sought revenge on the King and Queen for resisting the Hordes attempts at galactic control. Hordak sought to kidnap their children, but only managed to capture Adora as Man-At-Arms got to Adam first. Hordak then escaped, with the Princess, through an inter-dimensional portal that lead to the planet Etheria.</p>
        <p>The Sorceress of Castle Grayskull used her magic to cleanse the memories of Eternians so that only certain members of the Royal Family knew of what happened to the Princess, and the rest of the world's population could be spared the grief surrounding her loss. On Etheria, Adora was raised by Chakra, who provided for the young men and women that would grow up to serve Hordak.</p>
        <p>As Adora grew older she gained more and more special attention within Hordak's forces, and even attained the rank of Force Captain. One day, Adora was confronted by He-Man who, unknown to her, had traveled to Etheria through a portal created by the Sorceress at Castle Grayskull on Eternia. He was stunned and captured by Adora, which allowed her magical sword to come into her possession. The Sorceress was then able to communicate to Adora through the sword and reveal everything to her about her true identity. Adora then transformed into She-Ra for the first time, and rescued her brother.</p>
        <p>As the Princess of Power and defender of the Crystal Castle, She-Ra stands as the best defense against the Evil Horde on Etheria. And as Adora she leads "The Great Rebellion" against the mighty Horde on Etheria. With the words "For the honor of Grayskull...I am She-Ra!", Princess Adora transforms into the powerful Etherian rebel hero every time her help is needed. Carried on her friend and stead, Swift Wind, she became a powerful symbol of freedom for all on her adopted world.</p>
